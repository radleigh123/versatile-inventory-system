An adaptive approach to inventory management system.

---
The researchers formulated the scope and limitations of this project to identify the boundaries of the study. It has the following functionalities:
-	Features three business categories for the user to choose from during the setup process, e.g.:
    *	Retail business category will have products and suppliers window added
    * Service business category will have a scheduler added
-	User credentials authentication at login
-	A Standalone system that does not need Internet
-	Items in the system can be:
    * Viewed
    * Sorted
    * Edited, and
    * Removed

Hence, the proposed study is limited to the following:
-	The inventory system is only made to monitor inventories, such that printing the results or getting the prices of items are not in the system.
-	Large businesses such as bank, government are not suitable.
-	Human errors canâ€™t be determined by the system.
-	The system can accommodate only one business.
    * Attempting to add another business will result in deleteing the old one
-	Other types of businesses are not compatible with the system
